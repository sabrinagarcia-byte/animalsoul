        <h1>THE SOUL BEHIND THE ANIMAL SOUL</h1>
    </div>
        <section class="texto"> 
            <div class="text1">
                <p>It all started with a concern that was hard to ignore:<br>
                "How many animals need to disappear before someone truly listens?"<br>
                Animal Soul was born from this question and the urgent need to tell stories that the<br>
                world insists on ignoring. We are journalists, biologists, photographers, and wildlife lovers
                who decided to follow a different path. UA narrower, more difficult path, but with a purpose: 
                to give a voice to the animals that are disappearing in silence.</p>
            </div><br>

            <div class="text2">
                <p>We worked in traditional journalism. We lived surrounded by headlines and statistics, but<br> 
                    every time a story about an endangered animal came up, it was pushed aside.
                    It was "irrelevant," "didn't get clicks," "didn't sell." But for us, it was never just news; 
                    it was the last gasp of a species being ignored.</p>
            </div><br>

            <div class="text3">
                <p>That's when we decided to change everything.  To leave behind the hectic schedules and newsrooms and create something that didn't yet exist:
                    a journalism website dedicated 100% to covering stories of endangered animals.
                    Without filters, without distractions, without deviating from what matters. Thus, Animal Soul was born, 
                    a space where every species has a soul, every story matters, and every silence needs to be broken.</p>
            </div><br>

            <div class="text4">        
                    <p>We started small. A simple website, a few articles, a few photos of species that almost no one knew. 
                    But little by little, the spirit of Animal Soul grew: readers began to arrive. 
                    Then came the support, the partnerships with NGOs, scientists, activists, and people from all over the world who, like us, 
                    refuse to accept extinction as something normal. </p>
            </div><br>

            <div class="text5">
                <p> Today, Animal Soul is more than a website. It's a collective cry. It's resistance. It's memory. 
                    It's journalism that looks into the eyes of the last jaguar in a region and asks: "What can we do before it's too late?" 
                    Each article we publish is an act of care. Each photo is a tribute. Each piece of data is a warning. </p>
            </div><br>

            <div class="text6">
                <p>We are the voice of the forgotten. We are the soul of those who still fight. We are Animal Soul.</p>
